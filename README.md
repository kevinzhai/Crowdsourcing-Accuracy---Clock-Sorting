# Crowdsourcing-Accuracy---Clock-Sorting
Research project on the financial incentives for workers on the CrowdFlower platform. The accuracy vs. pay tier is analyzed and the results are summarized in FinalReport

-create_task.py is a Python script that takes the URL of clocks and times and then creates a randomized tuple of 3 clocks. The script is also used to to validate the answers that the workers give against the answer key that is generated.
